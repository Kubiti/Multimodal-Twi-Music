They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're gossiping about me
I'm tired, but I've gained a little; I’ve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, I’ll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesn’t move me
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, I’ll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesn’t move me
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I don’t go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself
The dream is to conquer hunger
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I don’t go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself

They say I'm quiet because I don't like people

They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy, ah!
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're out there tarnishing my name
I'm tired, but I’ve gained a little; I’ve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I’ve put my hand to the ground

Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free

Every day we test the street; we’re thugs
Don't act like you don’t see
It’s a lot for me, I’m trapping
I’m chasing money
At night I’m hunting
FB IG, I’m searching
Obuasi is online, I’m mining
Grrrrr for kele lele
If you don’t have money, it won’t be good
Let’s start it from a million
Spend euros pulling ra ra ra ra
Chilling with the girls
We drink Cognac with the strippers
Baileys

Come home and I’ll show you my talent
You know what comes with Kawabanga
We enter with full strength
Some brothers are falling
My brothers are calling
If you don’t roll with the gang, we’re shunning
Nana, what do you want?
I’m not going to beg you
Let me not drag this out
From Ghana to Sweden, ah
And I'm okay
What are you going to say?
Running the whole city back in the days
Pulling my lace
Came from the bottom
Damn, and the ladies are crushing on me
Oseikrom gangsta
Big ups to my hommies Reggie, YGA, Thunder
Came from humble beginnings
Now I’m entering
Been through a lot
So Willy gives me vodka
Kawabanga

Baby girl says I’m nice

Get some papers on my ice (Ice ice)

They enjoy the fine things, yet won’t let others even drink a sip from their cup
September 4th, 1990, something happened that took the world by surprise
My mother don't have, father don't have, 
We suffer
What the streets teach us is different—fraud, crime; in this world, no one is going to support you; just watch out and stay calm
Kweku, someone is asleep, but I'm wide awake
It’s your girl on the phone, and I’m trying to take her
I told Amina, she should stop wasting my time; if I get some money, we’re going to enjoy
I’m rising like a plantain leaf
What’s before me is laid right out
People say I won’t make it, but I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
I’ll take control, too
Yes, I’ll take control, too
I’m at a café in Taifa, staying alert like I’m on a sugar high
How many people you know who get 10k every week just like that?
We can even take the money from the spiritualist, but still, we’re going to sleep and thank God
The poverty in my family, all the needs—they go unsatisfied as if I don’t hear it
Ask Neha and Nasir, I’ll take my first 10k and count how much I’ll make
People go to sleep and dream while we stay awake, still grinding
I don’t have time for anyone; if you won’t help me, don’t bother; I’m awake
I’ll work hard with the boys
We’ll dig in and think
When we need it, we’ll go and grab some copies
If you stand with me, you’re my backup, you’re my support, you’re my posse
They know we’re on top, and they’re taking note (they understand)
Yeah, if I have what I need, your head will spin
Every night with the boys, we’re out there, speaking in code
Despite everything people do, we’re still holding on
The dream is big; we’ll get the money
One day, it’ll all come together
I’m rising like a plantain leaf

They enjoy the fine things, yet won’t let others even drink a sip from their cup
September 4th, 1990, something happened that took the world by surprise
My mother don't have, father don't have, 
We suffer
What the streets teach us is different—fraud, crime; in this world, no one is going to support you; just watch out and stay calm
Kweku, someone is asleep, but I'm wide awake
It’s your girl on the phone, and I’m trying to take her
I told Amina, she should stop wasting my time; if I get some money, we’re going to enjoy
I’m rising like a plantain leaf
What’s before me is laid right out
People say I won’t make it, but I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
I’ll take control, too
Yes, I’ll take control, too
I’m at a café in Taifa, staying alert like I’m on a sugar high
How many people you know who get 10k every week just like that?
We can even take the money from the spiritualist, but still, we’re going to sleep and thank God
The poverty in my family, all the needs—they go unsatisfied as if I don’t hear it
Ask Neha and Nasir, I’ll take my first 10k and count how much I’ll make
People go to sleep and dream while we stay awake, still grinding
I don’t have time for anyone; if you won’t help me, don’t bother; I’m awake
I’ll work hard with the boys
We’ll dig in and think
When we need it, we’ll go and grab some copies
If you stand with me, you’re my backup, you’re my support, you’re my posse
They know we’re on top, and they’re taking note (they understand)
Yeah, if I have what I need, your head will spin
Every night with the boys, we’re out there, speaking in code
Despite everything people do, we’re still holding on
The dream is big; we’ll get the money
One day, it’ll all come together
I’m rising like a plantain leaf
What’s before me is laid right out
They say I won’t make it

Arrh!
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Young Arthur preach!)
I’ve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say I’m weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I don’t have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind

Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day we’re stacking money double double
My mind’s on my money, we don’t want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
I’m ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, don’t care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
I’m grinding for things I’ve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
We’re like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Don’t waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face

Heavenly father knows I have to make it, I have to make it
My brothers from Site 1 are doing pushups for this
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
But many probably won’t vibe with this
Swerg! Poof! Damn!
Man, what day is today?
It’s not yesterday, I couldn’t even sleep in my bed
Because music money is only 20%
I’m a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like “I want change”
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
You’re lucky you don’t have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, it’s me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it
I’m always after paper
Zoomlion will sign me later (Swerg!)
I’m like Noreaga
I think I’m Big Meech, three weeks no sleep, too deep chasing dreams
Free Meek, feed me, bring beef, put this on repeat

If you say I should go
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Mr. Amakye Dede)
Arrh!
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Young Arthur preach!)
I’ve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say I’m weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I don’t have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day we’re stacking money double double
My mind’s on my money, we don’t want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
I’m ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, don’t care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
I’m grinding for things I’ve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
We’re like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Don’t waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face

My hope is to make it, I have to make it
This is for my real ones stuck in the trenches
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
This is like a six-mile race on park benches
Heavenly father knows I have to make it, I have to make it
My brothers from Site 1 are doing pushups for this
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
But many probably won’t vibe with this
Swerg! Poof! Damn!
Man, what day is today?
It’s not yesterday, I couldn’t even sleep in my bed
Because music money is only 20%
I’m a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like “I want change”
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
You’re lucky you don’t have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, it’s me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it
I’m always after paper
Zoomlion will sign me later (Swerg!)
I’m like Noreaga
I think I’m Big Meech, three weeks no sleep, too deep chasing dreams
Free Meek, feed me, bring beef, put this on repeat
Bayaka! Swerg!

One brick a day
Ground Up to the top
Every day hustle, don’t complain
Money is blood, I’m just trying to be filthy rich
Money isn’t scary
Stop being afraid of it
What did I tell you about chasing cash?
Go get it, and don’t gamble your life away
Ground up, Charlie
This is that “pull up in the Mercedes”
But you’re here talking about 2 cedis debt

Stop being afraid of it
What did I tell you about chasing cash?
Go get it, and don’t gamble your life away
Ground up, Charlie
This is that “pull up in the Mercedes”
But you’re here talking about 2 cedis debt
Let’s go!","HipHop,Asakaa","This song is about the relentless hustle and determination needed to escape poverty and achieve success.

If you say I should go
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Mr. Amakye Dede)
Arrh!
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Young Arthur preach!)
I’ve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say I’m weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I don’t have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day we’re stacking money double double
My mind’s on my money, we don’t want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
I’m ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, don’t care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
I’m grinding for things I’ve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
We’re like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Don’t waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face

My hope is to make it, I have to make it
This is for my real ones stuck in the trenches
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
This is like a six-mile race on park benches
Heavenly father knows I have to make it, I have to make it
My brothers from Site 1 are doing pushups for this
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
But many probably won’t vibe with this
Swerg! Poof! Damn!
Man, what day is today?
It’s not yesterday, I couldn’t even sleep in my bed
Because music money is only 20%
I’m a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like “I want change”
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
You’re lucky you don’t have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, it’s me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it
I’m always after paper
Zoomlion will sign me later (Swerg!)
I’m like Noreaga
I think I’m Big Meech, three weeks no sleep, too deep chasing dreams
Free Meek, feed me, bring beef, put this on repeat
Bayaka! Swerg!

Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Game boys, you’ve taken control, roll the dice for me
Windows down with the AC on
Now you’ve got a Bentley, got it?
This is Kayso from Tema
One brick a day
Ground Up to the top
Every day hustle, don’t complain
Money is blood, I’m just trying to be filthy rich
Money isn’t scary
Stop being afraid of it
What did I tell you about chasing cash?
Go get it, and don’t gamble your life away
Ground up, Charlie
This is that “pull up in the Mercedes”
But you’re here talking about 2 cedis debt
Let’s go!","HipHop,Asakaa","This song is about the relentless hustle and determination needed to escape poverty and achieve success. It emphasizes the importance of daily hard work, perseverance, and focusing on long-term wealth rather than quick cash.

If you say I should go
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Mr. Amakye Dede)
Arrh!
I’ve been, I’ve been, I’ve been (Young Arthur preach!)
I’ve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say I’m weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I don’t have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day we’re stacking money double double
My mind’s on my money, we don’t want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
I’m ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, don’t care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
I’m grinding for things I’ve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
We’re like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Don’t waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face
See the upcoming rap shows
Get tickets for your favorite artists
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
My hope is to make it, I have to make it
This is for my real ones stuck in the trenches
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
This is like a six-mile race on park benches
Heavenly father knows I have to make it, I have to make it
My brothers from Site 1 are doing pushups for this
Don’t give it to me, I’ll take it, I’ll take it
But many probably won’t vibe with this
Swerg! Poof! Damn!
Man, what day is today?
It’s not yesterday, I couldn’t even sleep in my bed
Because music money is only 20%
I’m a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like “I want change”
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
You’re lucky you don’t have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, it’s me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it
I’m always after paper
Zoomlion will sign me later (Swerg!)
I’m like Noreaga
I think I’m Big Meech, three weeks no sleep, too deep chasing dreams
Free Meek, feed me, bring beef, put this on repeat
Bayaka! Swerg!

I tried calling Jehovah, but it seems like there's no service for me
The devil is on my shoulder; everyone has their purpose
I’m dressing up and not looking at anyone; the streets have made me fearless
All my friends are progressing; even God seems disappointed in me (Ok!)

But the little money that reaches my hands, I have to give it to Pastor Dadzie

If it’s a Mercedes they have, the best I can hope for is a taxi, after all my struggles (huh!)
So when will it be my turn, Kwesi, when will I walk on the same path?
I’ve gone to school, I speak perfect English, yet people are blocking my way; who am I? Up all night

You’re sleeping on me, as if you don’t care
They tried to shoot me, but I dodged it
Who is that? (Who?)
Press my stomach, press my honor
If someone is a fool, I don’t call anyone
I’ll still finish it

We’re alert, like it’s winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name
La hustle ooh
If you don’t hustle, you’ll die (If you don’t hustle, you’ll die)
They’re waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Mmh mmh mmh
Mmh mmh mmh
Your foolishness (your foolishness)
Mmh mmh mmh (pow)

If you don’t hustle, you’ll die (If you don’t hustle, you’ll die)
They’re waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
They’re weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you can’t be faster than a car
You have no swag; you can’t afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikal’s around, but I’m still sick sick sick
You’re watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, I’ve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldn’t take your life away
If you don’t hustle, you’ll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, you’ll ghost him
You’re posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, he’s paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While you’re talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I don’t like (mmh)
Bad energy, I don’t like it (mmh)
If it’s going wrong, I don’t like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girl’s chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; she’s got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you don’t hustle, you’ll die
They’re waiting for money

Today’s not the day
I’m looking for money like it’s hide and seek we’re playing

Maybe we’re playing Mortal Kombat

A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name
La hustle ooh

I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikal’s around, but I’m still sick sick sick
You’re watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, I’ve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldn’t take your life away
If you don’t hustle, you’ll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, you’ll ghost him
You’re posing with fake Gucci

",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfkCdxA3Q7o,MP4,Twi,Neutral,"You won't believe what I saw on my way
A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
She’s always at home and doesn’t go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
There’s wealth at home, and when she eats pizza, she says it’s like konkonte (a local dish)
I told my friend about her, and he went to her house one day
When her dad is home, she doesn’t step outside
The boys want her, they’re all yearning for her
Agyeiwaa also makes me feel special
She’s not into the outside life; she says, “If you want to see me, come home”
The first time I saw Agyeiwaa, she blew my mind like Kyeiwaa (a popular actress)
I didn’t know she was a homebody but also wants to work
When you see her, her curves amaze you
Her body drives you crazy
I told her, “If you don’t like me, please don’t waste my time”
I’m troubled, and I can’t even sleep
Let’s go home and meet the family
The boys gossip, but I don’t mind
Agyeiwaa says she just wants to hold my hand
The things we do for love, it’s amazing what she’s willing to do
If I wrong her, she won’t say a word
You won’t believe what I saw on my way
A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
She’s always at home and doesn’t go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
I call, but she doesn’t pick up
Her friends tease her when they see us together
I’m a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because she’s classy
Her scent lingers, even if it’s not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich man’s son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
I’m a bad boy and she’s into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her
Every morning, she’s on my mind
She says Gucci doesn’t excite her as much as my love does
I’m from DC, not Dansoman
She calls me, and I hold her close
Last time we met, the whole YGA squad knew about it

A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
She’s always at home and doesn’t go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
I call, but she doesn’t pick up
Her friends tease her when they see us together
I’m a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because she’s classy
Her scent lingers, even if it’s not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich man’s son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
I’m a bad boy and she’s into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her
Every morning, she’s on my mind
She says Gucci doesn’t excite her as much as my love does
I’m from DC, not Dansoman
She calls me, and I hold her close

There’s wealth at home, and when she eats pizza, she says it’s like konkonte (a local dish)

When her dad is home, she doesn’t step outside
The boys want her, they’re all yearning for her
Agyeiwaa also makes me feel special
She’s not into the outside life; she says, “If you want to see me, come home”
The first time I saw Agyeiwaa, she blew my mind like Kyeiwaa (a popular actress)
I didn’t know she was a homebody but also wants to work
When you see her, her curves amaze you
Her body drives you crazy
I told her, “If you don’t like me, please don’t waste my time”
I’m troubled, and I can’t even sleep
Let’s go home and meet the family

I'm a hero from Heathrow
More money, more money, Pablo
",HipHop,"The song emphasizes success, wealth, and a relentless drive to rise above challenges, with references to luxury cars and lifestyle choices that highlight the artist's ambition and accomplishments.

One, two, three, yo
Let’s go to the red room, that’s where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
She’s a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
We’re mixing codeine with Benylin
I’ve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesn’t know I’m just a street boy, and my money is running out
I’m a street guy who speaks his mind
If you don’t act too tough, I’ll lay with you
I’ve prepared things, I’m excited
Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, you’ll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, you’ll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, you’ll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
I’ve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, I’ve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
She’s not too wild, she’s reserved
She’s composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesn’t show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, let’s spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I don’t sleep, I don’t mind
If she entices me, I can’t resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I won’t just undress you; I’ll place you carefully
She says I’m well-mannered
I couldn’t give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, you’re in my heart, that’s why I don’t sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
I’m at your door, that’s why I came
I’m entering your world
We’re in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If you’re free, let’s spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I don’t mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I can’t complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well

Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, you’ll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, you’ll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, you’ll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
I’ve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, I’ve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
She’s not too wild, she’s reserved
She’s composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesn’t show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, let’s spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I don’t sleep, I don’t mind
If she entices me, I can’t resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I won’t just undress you; I’ll place you carefully
She says I’m well-mannered
I couldn’t give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, you’re in my heart, that’s why I don’t sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
I’m at your door, that’s why I came
I’m entering your world
We’re in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If you’re free, let’s spend time together'

I’ve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong

I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesn’t know I’m just a street boy, and my money is running out

Asakaa, what’s up?
One, two, three, yo
Let’s go to the red room, that’s where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
She’s a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
We’re mixing codeine with Benylin
I’ve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesn’t know I’m just a street boy, and my money is running out
I’m a street guy who speaks his mind
If you don’t act too tough, I’ll lay with you
I’ve prepared things, I’m excited
Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, you’ll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, you’ll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, you’ll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
I’ve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, I’ve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
She’s not too wild, she’s reserved
She’s composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesn’t show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, let’s spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I don’t sleep, I don’t mind
If she entices me, I can’t resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
The money is there, she’ll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I won’t just undress you; I’ll place you carefully
She says I’m well-mannered
I couldn’t give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, you’re in my heart, that’s why I don’t sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
I’m at your door, that’s why I came
I’m entering your world
We’re in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If you’re free, let’s spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I don’t mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I can’t complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well

I’m on a path, walking and walking, but I still haven’t arrived.
Life’s got me thinking too deep, pushing me to smoke.
Money is all I need—if you see it, tell it I’m waiting.
One head, but my heart feels like thirteen, filled with stories both real and funny.
I’m in pain, and I need money to ease it.
The one chasing me in life is the one I’m running from.
Four times over, I feel this pressure.
Yo, YGA, O’Kenneth—hear my call.
If you’re hunting me, I curse you, for that’s how you’ve shaped me.
If things had gone well, I’d be better off.
Who understands me now? I’m like a headless sheep.
I’ve barely walked, yet they ask me to run.
Money—just thinking about it drives me mad.
It’s like a wild animal, lurking; if it’s nearby, let it come find me.
Food tastes like medicine, but I eat it anyway.
Even the brightest sun casts shadows.
If you owe, pay up—these streets don’t play.
I’m struggling, feeling empty, but I still wear my colors inside.
We move together, but traps are everywhere.
Ask me what’s wrong, and I wouldn’t know where to begin.
What I see online? Much of it’s fake.
I carry heavy burdens, uncertain of what troubles me the most.
All these struggles are for the hustle.
I’ve been searching, moving forward, running far from home.
I won’t stop now, not ever, not for anything.
My heart is metal, my words come from deep within.
Yes, I’m rough around the edges, a sinner, weary from the grind.
I need relief—give me something to lift this weight.
How can I live without a penny in my pocket, without a cedi or dollar to my name?
I’ve got to go harder, got to be ready.
Life’s beating me down, and I’m losing weight.
They’ve let my troubles loose, echoing in my mind, bound and relentless.
Hi, my hand is raised as I step inside.
Life’s struggles keep me up at night, the ones holding me back, still running.
My rent is due, and they’ve sent reminders.
But no matter how hard they press, I have no money to pay.










","HipHop,Asakaa","The song expresses a deep struggle with life’s hardships, especially the relentless pursuit of money to escape poverty and ease pain. The singer feels trapped, constantly chased by invisible pressures and weighed down by unfulfilled goals. Despite the overwhelming challenges, there’s a determined resolve to keep pushing forward, even while feeling broken and misunderstood.

I’m on a path, walking and walking, but I still haven’t arrived.
Life’s got me thinking too deep, pushing me to smoke.
Money is all I need—if you see it, tell it I’m waiting.
One head, but my heart feels like thirteen, filled with stories both real and funny.
I’m in pain, and I need money to ease it.
The one chasing me in life is the one I’m running from.
Four times over, I feel this pressure.
Yo, YGA, O’Kenneth—hear my call.
If you’re hunting me, I curse you, for that’s how you’ve shaped me.
If things had gone well, I’d be better off.
Who understands me now? I’m like a headless sheep.
I’ve barely walked, yet they ask me to run.
Money—just thinking about it drives me mad.
It’s like a wild animal, lurking; if it’s nearby, let it come find me.
Food tastes like medicine, but I eat it anyway.
Even the brightest sun casts shadows.
If you owe, pay up—these streets don’t play.
I’m struggling, feeling empty, but I still wear my colors inside.
We move together, but traps are everywhere.
Ask me what’s wrong, and I wouldn’t know where to begin.
What I see online? Much of it’s fake.
I carry heavy burdens, uncertain of what troubles me the most.
All these struggles are for the hustle.
I’ve been searching, moving forward, running far from home.
I won’t stop now, not ever, not for anything.
My heart is metal, my words come from deep within.
Yes, I’m rough around the edges, a sinner, weary from the grind.
I need relief—give me something to lift this weight.
How can I live without a penny in my pocket, without a cedi or dollar to my name?
I’ve got to go harder, got to be ready.
Life’s beating me down, and I’m losing weight.
They’ve let my troubles loose, echoing in my mind, bound and relentless.
Hi, my hand is raised as I step inside.
Life’s struggles keep me up at night, the ones holding me back, still running.
My rent is due, and they’ve sent reminders.
But no matter how hard they press, I have no money to pay.

Not all guys are brothers from another mother

I go protect your heart, make you be my diva

Like the way I love you, I watch you

Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart
I beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I have met many girls but I prefer your heart
Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva
I go spoil you so that you forget your sorrows

So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dɛ daadi, kina dɛ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains

In rap, me ne the king of the blacks
Your guys are like Canada blacks
Three years now, you have been the best rapper, it’s good, you're holding my plugs
I dey rhyme right in the lime light
Give us mic, then you see the lame ones
If you don't know what to say, just say my name once
In rap, I’m the light, I’m the main line
Continue doubting me, my nigga, even Satan knows the true God
Snooker, black balls are important, so don’t give Akosua blue balls
Every day, you’re sleeping, you have become a snail
My flow is tight, I’m not a waste
Use the fire to cook the good fish
If my verse drops, you will get a hit
They throw shots, but I throw bombs
You stand here, you say far gone
Same book, different authors
Ghana rap, it has nothing to do with stardom
We're pissed already, nobody is pissing us
Usain Bolt, who is chasing us?
My mouth is so precious, so my homie, I can't be kissing ass
Don’t come close to me, Zap Mallet height, do you measure Aboagye?
How many teaspoons make one ladle? Rap, if it’s your thing, take it

Digging my gold, selling no soul
Give me some kuta, and I’m gone
Holla at my thug niggas
Santamerica, all my Miami brothers are my blood niggas
I don’t mess with no false niggas
Niggas pretend with some false truths that they are living life
They ain't got no real life
In our circle, we scheme, we don’t earn a salary
That's a part of living
I’m with my gang gang, hmm hmm
Something red is on me hmm
Bandana, suwoop
My mother said she would tell Aunt Susana
Out of my way, out of my way

Bad bitches, I will have them
If you want to meet the gang, then let’s check your wallet
I don’t have time, but I’m free
Getting money with no degree
So when girls come, I’m a gee
Blood nigga from the city
And you said we’re sleeping
City boy, I don’t want trouble

We will rise, Akataboys on the road
We’re coming with heat, we’re going to top
Bandana on my head
I’m a bloody nigga, I’m going to ball
I don’t have time for fake friends
I’m a gangster, I’m coming to thug
No time to waste time
When I move to you, don’t trip
Akataboy Bin Laden
Bandana on my head, I’m not coming home
When I trap in the scene, I don’t listen
I’m a hard boy and now I’m chilling

They think we’re asleep, but we are up and awake
We’re on the road, you all niggas must wait
Jay Bahd, huhhh
He’s with the Akata boys all over the state
Covid-19, but our music is shaking
Virgil is here, you all should stay tuned
Kumerica, we’re overtaking, soon
On the way to success
We are the gang, Go-Lifers
Go be yourself, not others
Strippers, their address
Sipping lean with trappers
Overnight, we hunters
Kumerica, we’re the baddest
The illest
Hmm hmm
Yeah, Jay Bahd uh
","HipHop,Asakaa","The song reflects a confident and fearless lifestyle, emphasizing loyalty among friends and a commitment to success without fear of challenges.

Oseikrom boy, I ride in a taxi
We’ve earned money that’s worth it
My car can hold two, don’t worry
The girls are beautiful, they are something else
You didn’t understand that you’re loose when I come around
If I eat Indomie or other food,
You’ve turned your back on the money I have
You spin around 360
You paid for it at 360
My money’s going for whisky
When I’m on you, it’s like whisky
Eat from my pocket
And I too eat it well (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done

Oseikrom,
Mouthful! Mouthful!
The ladies have risen above Tripolis
When there’s something left to eat
I’ve gained and after that, I’m tackling better than John Terry
Look at my blue top
I don’t do drugs
When I’m pressed,
It’s neither loose nor draw
If I spend the night with you,
I’m in your space
I’m in your space (3x)

I’m with you in your space
Your space
Eat  from my pocket And I too eat your ayaase (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat it well

Listen, today I’m going to show you Kumerica, it’s not just a tale, it’s physical
You come to Oseikrom and we talk about the issues here, I’m a playmaker
Let me start with the Breman social media guys, we call it Texas
If you want a town where the game boys make it, it’s Breman; you shouldn’t trespass
Where do I come from, and where am I going?
Ebenezer, I’m heading to Abrepo
There, we are in Georgia where you can buy stuff
At Abrepo Junction, be careful because ladies go there
Dichemso is in West Virginia
In this town, if you’re too bold, they won’t spare you
Only gangsters live there, so if the chairman can’t handle it,
Don’t take your matters to Manhyia
Manhyia is in Washington DC
Show me the way so I can go to Florida
Look, I’m saying Bantama is their holiday
If your time is not right, don’t act like you’re white
If we go hard, you should know we don’t rest
Go around the roundabout, and we’re heading to Miami, Suame boys want to bet on Konami
Kwadaso is in Bronx and Krofrom is in Ohio
Behind Janet and sons, we’re going to hire
In this town, the rich people live like Las Vegas
Ahodwo is where I arrived to play
The players in Kumerica are in Tafo
In California in the morning, they’re making moves
Ashtown town is what we call New Jersey
Harvis Park morning means everyone wears their Jersey
Water girls mean Adum is where it’s happening
Kejetia, NEW York, I won’t bother you with my thoughts
Kronom, Oklahoma, for the popping
Asaano and Royal View, we’re thinking about ourselves
Amakom, Nebraska, Pankrono, Kentucky
Brokrom, Brooklyn boys, if you’re lucky
Oduom, Alabama, Abuakwa, Chicago
Pz, if you’re holding your phone, it’s Asafo Philadelphia boys are badder
I heard BB Kɔso, I brought Mirika
Kumasi Los Angeles with Patase sugar daddies tilapia
Some sell waakye here, but I won’t eat it; I don’t want your troubles
You took my girl to go do business
Asu Yeboah, I’m alone in Indiana
Mississippi atonsu, and I buy marijuana
And many people know I’m in Massachusetts
Aboabo is where I found my girl Amina
Another cool place is Danyame, Maryland
Old lady jollof and chicken wings, I’ll eat meat
Magazine macro Sundays, one in Michigan
Kumasi is the country, and I’m a proud Kumerican
Santase, Minnesota, on the road to Volta, it all matters, Opoku Ware, we’re sober
The town center is Asokwa, South Dakota
I’m heading to Oforikrom, which is like Arizona
Hehehe
Kumerica, Oseikrom",Asakaa,"The song ""Didi Me Botom"" by Ypee features a blend of bragging about wealth and lifestyle while celebrating the vibrant culture of Kumerica, a term that represents Kumasi and its surrounding areas in Ghana. The lyrics highlight the experiences of young people in these regions, showcasing their aspirations, challenges, and the social dynamics of their communities. Overall, it captures a sense of pride in local identity while emphasizing the fun and energetic spirit of youth life."

The town center is Asokwa, South Dakota
I’m heading to Oforikrom, which is like Arizona

The lyrics highlight the experiences of young people in these regions, showcasing their aspirations, challenges, and the social dynamics of their communities.

Listen, today I’m going to show you Kumerica, it’s not just a tale, it’s physical
You come to Oseikrom and we talk about the issues here, I’m a playmaker
Let me start with the Breman social media guys, we call it Texas
If you want a town where the game boys make it, it’s Breman; you shouldn’t trespass
Where do I come from, and where am I going?
Ebenezer, I’m heading to Abrepo
There, we are in Georgia where you can buy stuff
At Abrepo Junction, be careful because ladies go there
Dichemso is in West Virginia
In this town, if you’re too bold, they won’t spare you
Only gangsters live there, so if the chairman can’t handle it,
Don’t take your matters to Manhyia
Manhyia is in Washington DC
Show me the way so I can go to Florida
Look, I’m saying Bantama is their holiday
If your time is not right, don’t act like you’re white
If we go hard, you should know we don’t rest
Go around the roundabout, and we’re heading to Miami, Suame boys want to bet on Konami
Kwadaso is in Bronx and Krofrom is in Ohio
Behind Janet and sons, we’re going to hire
In this town, the rich people live like Las Vegas
Ahodwo is where I arrived to play
The players in Kumerica are in Tafo
In California in the morning, they’re making moves
Ashtown town is what we call New Jersey
Harvis Park morning means everyone wears their Jersey
Water girls mean Adum is where it’s happening
Kejetia, NEW York, I won’t bother you with my thoughts
Kronom, Oklahoma, for the popping
Asaano and Royal View, we’re thinking about ourselves
Amakom, Nebraska, Pankrono, Kentucky
Brokrom, Brooklyn boys, if you’re lucky
Oduom, Alabama, Abuakwa, Chicago
Pz, if you’re holding your phone, it’s Asafo Philadelphia boys are badder
I heard BB Kɔso, I brought Mirika
Kumasi Los Angeles with Patase sugar daddies tilapia
Some sell waakye here, but I won’t eat it; I don’t want your troubles
You took my girl to go do business
Asu Yeboah, I’m alone in Indiana
Mississippi atonsu, and I buy marijuana
And many people know I’m in Massachusetts
Aboabo is where I found my girl Amina
Another cool place is Danyame, Maryland
Old lady jollof and chicken wings, I’ll eat meat
Magazine macro Sundays, one in Michigan
Kumasi is the country, and I’m a proud Kumerican
Santase, Minnesota, on the road to Volta, it all matters, Opoku Ware, we’re sober
The town center is Asokwa, South Dakota
